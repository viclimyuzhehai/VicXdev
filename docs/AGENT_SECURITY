Agent security and permissions (read first)

- The Agent runs locally inside the Electron app (no cloud access).
- All filesystem writes, folder creation, removals, renames, and command executions require explicit user confirmation in the UI.
- For multi-file/batch operations, the Agent will offer to create a git backup commit (recommended) before making changes.
- Batch tasks still prompt per subtask to minimize accidental destructive operations.
- Do not enable fully autonomous execution unless you fully trust the code and workspace.
- Always keep backups and use git before running large changes.
